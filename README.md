# MLP
MLP for image classification implementation for the course of Machine Learning at AUEB.
Datasets used: 
  1. [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
  2. [MNIST](https://workupload.com/file/WtNd4k2sNzS)

### Built With
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

## Usage
1. Download the datasets linked above. For CIFAR-10 you should download the python version.
2. Drop the dataset folders (mnistdata, cifar-10-batches-py) inside the project folder, it should look something like this:
   * mnistdata folder
   * cifar-10-batches-py folder
   * MLP notebook
4. Open the MLP.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any IDE with the Jupyter Notebook Extension.
5. Run all the function definition cells.
6. Run ONE of the 2 load data cells and then run all the other cells.
   * NOTE: Skip the last cell if you don't wish to run the gradCheck (since it takes a while ~ 10 minutes).
8. You're all set!
